Ex: The man who lives next door is very friendly.(Người đàn ông sổng ở nhà bên cạnh rất thản thiện.)

1. Đại từ quan hệ (Relative pronouns)

### Mệnh đề quan hệ xác định (Defining relative clauses)
Mệnh đề quan hệ xác định là mệnh đề được dùng để xác định danh từ đứng trước nó. Mệnh đề xác định là mệnh đề cần thiết cho ý nghĩa của câu, không có nó câu sẽ không đủ nghĩa.

Ex: 
- The woman you met yesterday works in advertising.
- The book you lent me was very interesting.
- Do you remember the day we met each other?

### Mệnh đề quan hệ không xác định (Non-defining relative clauses)

Mệnh dề không xác định là mệnh đề không nhất thiết phải có trong câu, không có nó câu vẫn đủ nghĩa. Mệnh đề quan hệ không xác định được phân ranh giới với mệnh đề chính bằng các dấu phẩy (,) hoặc dấu gạch ngang (-).
Ex:

- We went to the Riverside Restaurant, where I once had lunch with Henry. (Chúng tôi đến Nhà Hàng Riverside, nơi mà trước đây tôi đã ăn trưa với Henry.)

Không dùng đại từ quan hệ that trong mệnh đề quan hệ không xác định (non-defining relative clause).
Ex: 
- Ms Smith, who(m) you met at our house, is going to marry next week. (Cô Smith, người mà anh đã gặp tại nhà chúng tôi, sẽ kết hôn vào tuần tới.) [NOT that you met at our house, ...]
- Harry told me about his new job, which he’s enjoying very much. (Harry kể cho tôi nghe về công việc mới mà anh ta rất thích.) [NOT .... that-he^s-enjoy-ing very much]

Ex: Peter, who(m) everybody suspected, turned out to be innocent.
(Peter, người bị mọi người nghi ngờ, hóa ra không có tội.)
[NOT Peter, everybody suspected, ...]

nghĩa cho cả câu.

(Mưa suốt đêm, điều đó tốt cho khu vườn.)
[which có nghĩa ‘the fact that it rained all night’] Max isn’t home yet, which worries me.
